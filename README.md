## *PyVirtualAudioCable*

My understanding of a virtual audio cable: Just as there are printer drivers that do not connect to a printer at all but rather write to a PDF file.

Analogously there are virtual audio drivers available that do not connect to a physical microphone at all but can pipe input from other sources such as files or other programs.

### *Modules*

Python packages that could be used:

- **`PyAudio`**

**NOTE**: facing error while installing (*windows installation*) `pyaudio`, similar to what I faced while installing the `face_recognition` module. ([FIX](https://github.com/ageitgey/face_recognition/issues/175))

Use `pip install pipwin` and then use `pipwin install pyaudio` ([Ref](https://roytuts.com/python-voice-recording-through-microphone-for-arbitrary-time-using-pyaudio/))

- `playsound`
  - `playsound()` function plays the sound in the audio file and blocks until the file reading is completed, you can pass block=False to make the function run asynchronously.
- `pydub` (alternative to playsound - but has much more features, [pydub](https://github.com/jiaaro/pydub))
  - **`pydub`** requires **`pyaudio`** for audio playback, but with `ffmpeg` installed, it lets you play a large range of audio formats with only a few lines of code.

* **`simpleaudio`** lets you play WAV files and NumPy arrays, and gives you options to check whether a file is still playing.
* **`python-sounddevice`** and **`pyaudio`** provide bindings for the PortAudio library for cross-platform playback of WAV files

  * [python-sounddevice: device selection](https://python-sounddevice.readthedocs.io/en/0.3.7/#device-selection)
  * [python-sounddevice: Input to Output passthrough](https://python-sounddevice.readthedocs.io/en/0.4.1/examples.html#input-to-output-pass-through)
* **`winsound`** allows you to play WAV files or beep your speakers, but it works only on Windows.
